				Dal Baati is not just a dish; it is a symbol of Rajasthan’s rich culinary
				heritage.
				This traditional delicacy consists of crispy, golden-brown baatis (wheat
				dumplings) served with aromatic,
				spiced dal (lentils) and a generous drizzle of pure ghee. The baatis are baked
				to perfection,
				offering a delightful crunch that pairs beautifully with the flavorful dal.
				Often accompanied by churma, a sweet, crumbled wheat dessert, this meal is a
				true celebration of Rajasthani flavors.
				At The Royal Palace, we prepare Dal Baati with authentic techniques,
				ensuring that every bite takes you on a journey to the royal kitchens of
				Rajasthan </p>

				The story of The Royal Palace is deeply rooted in Rajasthan’s glorious past,
				where food was not just a meal but a symbol of culture, tradition, and
				hospitality.
				Inspired by the legendary feasts of Rajput kings, our restaurant was founded
				with a vision
				to preserve and celebrate the authenticity of Rajasthani cuisine.
				Every recipe we serve has been passed down through generations,
				keeping alive the rich flavors that once graced the royal thalis of Mewar,
				Marwar,
				and Shekhawati. Our interiors reflect the grandeur of historic palaces, adorned
				with
				intricate artwork, antique décor, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere. The Royal
				Palace is
				more than just a restaurant—it is a tribute to Rajasthan’s regal heritage,
				bringing his
				tory to life with every dish we serve </p>
